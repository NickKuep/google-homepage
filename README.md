    The main objective of this project is to deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. This is to build confidence with:
    -Opening and accessing devtools on the Chrome Browser
    -Navigating and controlling the dev tools with a basic understanding
    -Using tools to manipulate the HTML and CSS elements
    -Learn how the code translate into the visual representation that is seen on the Web Browser
    -Getting more comfortable with the workflow of git/github
    -Messing around and seeing how to reduce a beautiful, pain-stakingly made, fully functioning page down to nothing >:)
